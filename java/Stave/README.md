# Stave.java: Modified Edition (ModifiedStave) 

Welcome to the **`ModifiedStave.java!`**

This edition is built upon the classic Stave game and introduces several exciting enhancements to the core gameplay:

* **Multiplayer Mode** (2 players supported for now) 👥

* **Customizable Rolls** (Setting how many rolls or rounds the game will last) 🎲

* **Personal Usernames:** Each player can enter a unique username to personalize the experience and track scores easily.

* **Secret *"Rigging"* Feature:** A hidden mode that guarantees a specific player name wins, for a fun prank! 😉

To start the game, simply compile and run the `ModifiedStave.java` file from the `ModifiedStave` folder.



## How to Rig the Game? (The Secret Win) 🤫

The "Rigging" feature allows you to ensure a specific name of a player is declared the winner, regardless of the final scores. This feature is only available when playing in **Multiplayer Mode**. Follow these steps to activate the secret prompt to set the name:

1. Start the game by running `ModifiedStave.java`.

2. Enable Multiplayer by typing '`Y`' when prompted.
    > Do you want to play Multiplayer (2 player)? [Answer with 'Y' or 'N' for yes or no] --> **Y**

3. **Find the Start Prompt:** Wait until you see the following prompt, asking you to start the game:
    > Click ENTER to start the game...

5. **Enter the Secret Code:** **DO NOT** press Enter yet. Instead, type the secret code `~_~` before pressing the Enter key.

   Your input should look exactly like this:

    > Click ENTER to start the game...  **\~\_\~**

6. **Enter the Rigged Name:** A new prompt will appear, asking you to input the username of the player you want to win. Enter the exact name of the player that you will be using at the start of the game.
    > You are currently RIGGING the game (for MULTIPLAYER)!!!
    >
    > Enter the rigged name {\"mu ha ha ha ha\" (evil laughter)}: **[enter the name here]**

The player whose name you enter here will automatically be declared the winner at the end of the match, no matter the score. Enjoy! 😆
